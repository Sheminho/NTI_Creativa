## Project Overview
This project is a data analysis of real estate listings in Egypt, sourced from OLX.com through Kaggle. The dataset contains information about listed houses, including their prices, types, and various features. I used Excel to clean, explore, and analyze this dataset, with a focus on understanding patterns and trends in the Egyptian real estate market.
